        That Bush is Not Burning is a publication where written content is delivered to your email address. Content covers historical research, book reviews, art criticism, and independent essays by Bailey Sheehan/ and other artists and writers. An archive of writings published prior to ‘your’ signing up is available for purchase. This method of distribution seems most ethical.

        Let me explain:
      </p>
      <p>
        (sometimes) I get really nervous that &#9;&#9; critique, or critical thought can bestow qualities, narratives and actions unto an object outside what is empirically given. I believe the institution of art is most susceptible to enacting this accidental legitimization of fictive qualities unto things. Art institutions (museums, universities, and local galleries) are most susceptible to this, because an enormous part of contemporary and post-contemporary arts’ success is its indeterminacy (what it can be, rather than what it is/ how it is acting). I am annoyed—- these fictive qualities that are legitimized by critique, and personal meaning making, often go on to produce real affect, which in turn stands to be—&#9;manipulated (for little, if any return). There is certainly a collective cognitive dissonance between an art writers’ “freedom” to express through creativity what a work may mean, and how little that expression matters in a works’ success (what is supposed to be an even exchange of power between an art institution and its constituents). So, this publication will be interested more in effect than cause, and “evocation rather than explanation”. Art criticism and critical thought do not represent the institution of art— insofar as they are an active participant in the institution of art, and help to constitute its hegemony. Thus we need to retreat into a network that is somewhat enclosed. Here the writer may set ethicals bounds to their practice (the annihilation of: metaphor, symbology, virtue signaling, and psychoanalysis) in an arena that encourages an understanding that, even though those bounds will never be met there is greater pleasure in that failure than the comfort that accompanies succumbing to our institutional training. That Bush is Not Burning, will attempt to detail exactly what an ethical writing practice and an even power exchange between the many institutions of art and their constituents may look like through both exposition and implemented practice.
